This is the repository of the TechTalks.xyz source code. This project is based on [beavy community building framework](https://www.github.com/beavyHQ/beavy/). Development generally happens there, this repository only contains the local changes and
configuration for this specific instance. In doubt, you probably want to send PRs against Beavy directly.
